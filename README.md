# Hotel Room Booking System

This project is a comprehensive solution for managing rooms in a hotel, offering a user-friendly interface for both administrators and customers. It empowers users to create, edit, delete, and view room bookings, transforming it into a robust hotel booking system. The project is built using the following technologies:

## Front-end
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- React

## Back-end
- Node.js
- Express.js

## Database
- MongoDB

### Key Functionalities

#### User Features:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can securely log in or sign up using JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
   - Two roles are supported: CUSTOMER and ADMIN.

2. **Role-Based Access:**
   - Different roles have different access levels.
   - **CUSTOMER:**
     - Can request room bookings.
     - Can view all available rooms.
   - **ADMIN:**
     - Can manage rooms, bookings, and users.

3. **Booking Rooms:**
   - Customers can book rooms by providing necessary details such as name, email, room preferences, start time, and end time.
   - The price of the booking updates dynamically as customers modify any booking details.
   - Overlapping bookings for the same room are not allowed.

4. **Editing Bookings:**
   - Customers can edit their booking details, including personal information and reservation details.
   - The updated price is recalculated upon confirmation.

5. **Canceling Bookings:**
   - Customers can cancel future bookings with refund conditions:
     - If the booking start time is more than 48 hours, a complete refund is issued.
     - If the booking start time is within 24 to 48 hours, a 50% refund is issued.
     - Otherwise, no refund is provided, but customers can still cancel the booking.

6. **Viewing Bookings:**
   - Customers can view their own bookings, both upcoming and past reservations.
   - Admins can view all bookings, both upcoming and passed, with various filters:
     - Filter by room number and room type.
     - Filter by start time and end time.

## Email Confirmation Feature

We've added an exciting new feature to enhance user experienceâ€”the Email Confirmation feature. Now, users will receive email confirmations for successful room bookings, providing them with a detailed record of their reservation.

### How It Works

When a user successfully books a room, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the provided email address. The email contains important details such as the reservation dates, room preferences, and any other relevant information.
