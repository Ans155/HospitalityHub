4. **Editing Bookings:**

   - Customers can cancel future bookings with refund conditions:
     - If the booking start time is more than 48 hours, a complete refund is issued.
     - If the booking start time is within 24 to 48 hours, a 50% refund is issued.
     - Otherwise, no refund is provided, but customers can still cancel the booking.

6. **Viewing Bookings:**

   - Admins can view all bookings, both upcoming and passed, with various filters:

## Email Confirmation Feature

We've added an exciting new feature to enhance user experienceâ€”the Email Confirmation feature. Now, users will receive email confirmations for successful room bookings, providing them with a detailed record of their reservation.

### How It Works

When a user successfully books a room, a confirmation email is automatically sent to the provided email address. The email contains important details such as the reservation dates, room preferences, and any other relevant information.
